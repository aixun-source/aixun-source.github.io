            Welcome to my blog. This is to ensure that the people keep funding my dark reptilian society. 
            In this, I will be posting a bunch of blog posts in an attempt for them to be indexed by SEO.
            At the end of my module, I will be posting an article on how the process was done. 
            And yes, I built this website from scratch. Please don't ask how I did this, it took 
            a day to finish everything. Of course, I will be improving on it and adding stuff as I learn 
            how to CSS.
